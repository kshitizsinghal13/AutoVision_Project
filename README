# AI-Powered Image Analyzer

This project is a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload images for analysis using Google's Generative AI. The application processes images and provides descriptions as if guiding a blind friend, while also detecting illegal, dangerous, or suspicious elements. It features voice output and logs all responses for future reference.

## Features
- Upload images for AI-based analysis
- Receive concise and meaningful descriptions
- Identify famous individuals, song lyrics, and references
- Provide navigation details for the visually impaired
- Store analysis logs for reference
- Convert results to speech output using pyttsx3
- Accessible remotely via Ngrok

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5 Flash)
- PIL (Pillow) for image processing
- Pyttsx3 for text-to-speech
- Pyngrok for remote access
